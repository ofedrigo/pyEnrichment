pyEnrichment
============

This is a program package that allows for testing gene ontology enrichment from a list of genes associated to a value (e.g. p-value). Ralph Haygood and I developed this package for the following manuscripts:
<ul>
<li>Haygood, R.*, O. Fedrigo*,B. Hanson, K.-D. Yokoyama, and G. A. Wray. (2007) Promoter regions of many neural- and nutrition-related genes have experienced positive selection during human evolution. Nature Genetics. 39(9): 1140:1144.</li>
<li>Babbitt C.C., O. Fedrigo, A.D. Pfefferle, A.P. Boyle, J.E. Horvath, T.S. Furey, and G.A. Wray. (2010). Both noncoding and protein-coding RNAs contribute to gene expression evolution in the primate brain. Genome Biology and Evolution. 0:67â€“79.</li>
</ul>
